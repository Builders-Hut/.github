## Hello there! Welcome to Builders Hut

### What exactly is Builders Hut?

Builders hut is an initiative by [IEEE Computer Socitey](https://github.com/orgs/ComputerSocietyVITC/) to act buildspace-like,
where members can learn and develop new skills while building projects regardless of
which they department they belong to, because at our core we all love tech.

### How does this event work?

Either weekly or biweekly, members will vote on ideas for projects. Project ideas will be given by members themselves.
The project with most votes is chosen and then there will be a discussion on that saturday, 
to decide the finer details of the projects, the tech stack to be used etc. 
The day after that there will be a short seminar of sorts so that people who arenâ€™t 
acquainted with the tech stack used can get a small background of it, which they can further work 
upon while they work on the project. Once the deadline is over, 
there will be a short presentation of the project and this cycle will repeat!

**NOTE:** 
Every aspect of the project will be decided by the members and the members only. Everything from the technology to be used down to the finer details like logos and color scheme etc.

**Built by Builders, Used by Builders**
