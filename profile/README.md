## Hello there! Welcome to Builders Hut

### What exactly is Builders Hut?

Builders Hut is an innitiative taken up by [@Aditya Jyoti](https://github.com/Aditya-Jyoti/)
powered by [@IEEE Computer Society](https://github.com/ComputerSocietyVITC/) following the
ideology of **Learn While Building**.

We have seen a lot of people coming from technical asking questions
about how do they get started with using their skills to actually build usable and functional
"products". We see people coming from non technical backgrounds asking, how do they actually
develop these skills.

And thats where **Builders Hut** comes in.

We are an organization of people holding workshops, seminars and project reviews, for our
peers so that one day they can hold something similar and teach us about their interests.

**By the people, Of the people, For the people** rightly describes this sentiment.

Every month we shall hold **one**

- Seminar: Teaches people the prerequisites that will go into building the project of the month.
- Workshop: Actual introduction to the technology being touched during that month.
- Project Review: Where everyone submits individual or team projects built using that technology.

**But what can you expect to learn from Builders Hut?**

The options are endless, from web development, app development to game development to actually
learning how to sell your products to how you should manage a team etc.

We will not only work on technical but non technical skills as well.

And not only us, you will also be given a chance to make use of your skills and teach the same
to other people, the platform is open for all to claim.

**DISCLAIMER**

We are not people who will spoonfeed solutions to you. There will come a moment where you would
have to depend on yourself to google for solutions, refer various resources and ofcourse
LLMs like ChatGPT and Claude exist.

If you think that you won't have to do anything and you will get everything you want, then we are
**not the organization for you**.

We can only help you if you **want to help yourself**
